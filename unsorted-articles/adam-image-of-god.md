# Adam - Image of God

Adam was given the task of expanding the sacred space of Eden \(the presence of God\) not just by working and keeping the Garden-Temple, but also by giving birth to other humans who would serve as even more image-bearers. Jesus, the second Adam, was tasked with resuming Adam's original task. But now, the earth is filled with people who are ignorant of their task, and even antagonistic to it. We have the challenge of changing their minds and hearts, and filling the earth with image-bearers through the New "Birth" process.
