# OneSentForth - The Book

I need to write a summary of all the things we're going to discuss in the book.

Full circle... God "sends" us out in the process of creation - "yarah." And "torah" is the path that we were sent on in order to reach the intended destination. In Greek, it's the "telos." Paul says Jesus is the telos of the torah \(end of the law\).

Adam had a chaos-to-order task. Expand and extend Eden. Jesus had a chaos-to-order task of establishing a New Eden or kingdom. Our task is to extend or expand _that_ Eden.
