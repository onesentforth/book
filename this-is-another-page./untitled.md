# Call to Adventure

**From the Preface of John Walton's** _**Lost World of Scripture:**_   
****"This book is about a lost world. But **it’s not about a search for lost books, or lost chalices, or the lost Atlantis of Plato. This is a search for a lost culture that had a significant effect on how the Bible was written.**   
Remarkably, even after thousands of years of people reading and studying the Bible, there is still more to learn and understand. That says a lot about the nature of the Bible and its divine author. But another reason calls for continuing study of Scripture. **Like archaeologists finding ossuaries in ancient Jewish tombs, or mudlarkers digging up ancient Roman coins in the tidal mud of the Thames River, or scuba divers uncovering a sunken Greek ship in the Mediterranean Sea, scholars are constantly exploring more and more of the ancient world and finding increasingly interesting insights.** And all of that has potential for offering clearer understanding of the inspired and authoritative Word of God.  
In this book we are exploring ways God chose to reveal his Word in light of discoveries about ancient literary culture. **Our specific objective is to understand better how both the Old and New Testaments were spoken, written and passed on, especially with an eye to possible implications for the Bible’s inspiration and authority**."
