# Book Structure

You need to think deeply about the art you admire and ask yourself this simple question… “If \(insert the omnipotent power of your choice\) were to descend from the heavens and demand that I create my masterpiece how would I do that?” The way I would do that is to think deeply about how the great works I admire work…and then apply the principles inherent in them to guide me. In the "Reader Group Guide" at the back of The Tipping Point, Gladwell answers the question, "How you you classify The Tipping Point?" His response: **"I like to think of it as an intellectual adventure story."**  
The first question an editor/author must answer is: “What’s the Genre?” Gladwell's response makes it clear that he wanted it to have the feel, the sensibility, and most importantly the narrative velocity of an action/adventure Story. But **instead of the lead character of his book pursuing a bad guy or a prize or a stolen nuclear warhead, Gladwell wanted his lead character to pursue an idea. Not just pursue it, but attack it with all of the vim and vigor of Bruce Willis in Die Hard.**

Action Adventure Stories \(aka Man Against Nature\) use the natural world or a specific setting as the villain/force of conflict. They can be further delineated by four kinds of plot devices:

* Labyrinth Plot: The object of desire is to save victim\(s\) and get out of a maze-like edifice. \(Die Hard\)
* The Monster Plot: The villain is an animal. \(Jaws\)
* The Environment Plot: The villain is the actual global setting \(Gravity\)
  * _KJW - Within this plot device could be a Story where an overarching \(false/destructive\) IDEA is the villain._
* The Doomsday Plot: The victim is the environment. The hero must save the environment from disaster \(Independence Day\)

Now to tell an Action story you must have at least three characters. They are:

* The hero - A Hero is a character who sacrifices himself to free victim/s of the villain/s.
* The victim - those who are suffering because of the conflict.
* The villain - the villain is the force that provides all of the conflict

These are not suggestions. Without a hero, a victim and a villain, you just can’t deliver an Action story. That doesn’t mean that there can only one hero, one victim or one villain. You could have a number of heroes with differing individual traits who come together as a unit to free a single victim or a group of victims from a single villain or a group of villains. The key though is that the sum total of the individual parts of the heroic cast must add up to a formidable force of strength. The Seven Samurai, The Dirty Dozen, Gates of Fire, Inglorious Basterds, Ocean’s Eleven, Ghostbusters, are examples of stories with multi-protagonist/heroes.

And remember also that the hero can also play the victim role too. A great example of that is The Fugitive. Or in the case of The Incredible Hulk, depending upon the situation, the Hulk can play hero, victim or villain. All three. Or another show-stopper, one of my all time favorites…Chuck Palahniuk’s masterpiece Fight Club. All three \(hero, victim and villain\)…all in one character. Brilliant! _KJW - This is somewhat the case in our situation. We have essentially caused our own crisis by choosing wrong beliefs \(villain\). We are suffering from these false beliefs \(victim\). And we are the one\(s\) who must act to save ourselves \(hero\). Obviously, Jesus accomplished the main act of heroism. But we must act on our own to activate the effects._ The three roles must be filled, but again they do not have to be filled by a single character. Part of the innovative fun is figuring out the cast. But above all, the villain is the crucial role to fill in an Action story…because **the villain is the force that provides all of the conflict. And conflict drives Story.** 

**The villain of The Tipping Point \(and all of Nonfiction for that matter\) is the human condition.** In an Action Adventure Story, the hero sacrifices and fights the villain to free the victim. And that’s exactly what Malcolm Gladwell does in The Tipping Point.

## Genre: Big Idea Non-fiction

### Conventions and Obligations of Big Idea Non-fiction \([http://bit.ly/2e8F4HK](http://bit.ly/2e8F4HK)\):

* Over-arching Idea that is both surprising and inevitable
  * David Mamet, on what makes a story work: “They start with a simple premise and proceed logically, and inevitably, toward a conclusion both surprising and inevitable.”
* Three Classic Forms of Argument and Persuasion
  * Ethos - Does the writer have the character and background to be someone worthy of trust? Is he principled? Does he have experience in the arena in which he writes? Is he an expert? \[Writer takes center-stage\]
  * Logos - the evidence/the data/the backup material that the arguer/writer uses to support his conclusions. Because of the following data/examples/case studies, logically we can conclude… \[Evidence takes center-stage\]
  * Pathos - appealing to the emotions of his audience to get them on his side, arousing readers’ anger or appealing to their self-interest or sense of identity. As you’ll surmise, employing a fiction writer’s Story techniques is crucial to being able to make this form of persuasion for a Nonfiction writer. \[Emotional appeal to reader through Story takes center-stage\]
* Tease the reader with narrative cliffhangers
  * Create narrative drive…mystery, suspense and dramatic irony.
  * Keep the reader glued to the page by regulating the amount of information given to the reader. Not too much and not too little. Just enough.
* “Big Reveal" - the moment in which the reader discovers that what he’s always believed about a particular phenomenon is spectacularly wrong.
  * This “Big Reveal” is akin to the global story climax in a novel.
* Evidence
* Prescriptive, how-to advice to apply the knowledge revealed from the Big Idea in everyday life.
* Entertaining anecdotes - these bits are sticky, easy to remember and spread to friend or acquaintance.
