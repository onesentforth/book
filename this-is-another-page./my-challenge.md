# My Challenge

**Our Challenge.** We have the challenge of engaging the ideas and philosophies of world in order to prove what is actually true, i.e. Reality. As part of this challenge, we have a book, written over the course of thousands of years, in multiple languages, depicting a culture that is completely foreign to us. We must learn that culture and those languages in order to understand the meaning of the writings we're supposed to use in proving the Truth.

I face the same kind of challenge as CIA agents in the movie _Sicario_. They have the same goal as the local police officers: stop the illegal drug trade along with the violence and death that typifies it. The problem is that the police already view themselves as experts. They believe that their views and practices are correct. The CIA knows better. They know that the tactics of the police are ineffective, but it's nearly impossible to convince the officers. In order to convince them, the CIA needs to bring the police to a crisis - a moment where they may be willing to re-examine their ideas and practices.
